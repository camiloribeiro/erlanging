Max Subsequence
===============

This is the first exercise I am trying to solve. We started this exercise in Clojure in a Dojo at ThoughtWorks 

The main goal here is to write a program that read a sequence of numbers and get the biggest increasing sequecence.

Example: 3 8 4 2 6 7 0 1 9

In the example above we wold select the following sequence 3 4 6 7 9

So, get it done
