Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
===================================

Create a simple calculator that uses the Reverse Polish Notation

Example of simple expression:

1 2 +
It means 1 + 2 and should return 3

exemple of complex operation:

4 6 + 5 * 2 / 2 -
It means 4 + 6 = 10, so 10 * 5 = 50, so 50 / 2 = 25, so 25 -2 = 23.
